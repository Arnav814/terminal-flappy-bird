flappy-bird
===========

![image](./media/ingame.svg)

This is a terminal implementation of flappy bird. It's written in C++ and uses ncurses to do most
of the work of displaying stuff. As of now, it only runs on Linux. It might also run on MacOS, but
I haven't tested it. It probably won't run on Windows.

For installation instructions, see INSTALL.md
